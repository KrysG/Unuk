~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TODO:

*Menu:
~~~~~
- New Game
- SaveGame loading
  - New screen or make buttons appear on the menu
- SaveGame deleting
- Game Settings
  - Keybindings
  - Fullscreen

*Fix NPC animation

*Map Editor:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Change the array of tiles into a list of tiles.
- Get a tile selection marker and display the current tile info.

*Proper collision testing.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- MapTile objects store a list of character* 's
  - The character class will add and remove themselves from the list in the MapTile.
  - When the Character class wants to check for collisions it hands a pointer to
	itself to the MapTile object, the MapTile will then return true if any
	Character in it's list collides with the Character* it just recieved.
  - Create the appropriate methods in the MapTile class
    - bool CheckCollision(Character *charptr);
    - void AddCharacter(Character *charptr);
    - void RemoveCharacter(Character *charptr);

*A way for entities to store information (Like items).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Sort out how we will read in the information
  - A list of present objects that can be referenced with a single word in the map file.
