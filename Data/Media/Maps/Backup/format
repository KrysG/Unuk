off/null in the string fields is represented by "null".

A solid entity is only possible if the entity is smaller than a tile.

A tile with the texture "null" must be used to make the map rectangular, this is to avoid onion skinning.

A zLevel of 100 is the floor.

A zlevel of -1 means a ladder or ramp, it temporarily turns off the zLevel movement restrictions for the player,
	the next tile that the player walks upon will be the new zLevel of the player.
There must be solid tiles to either side of the ladder/ramp.

A map name in the transition field will make the game switch to that map when the player walks onto that tile.

The last two fields are the x,y that the player should be transported to if the map is changed.
